# Mobile Device Setup Guide

Your Flutter app is now configured to connect to your FastAPI server running on your laptop from a mobile device.

## 📱 **Current Configuration**

- **Laptop IP Address**: `192.168.8.100`
- **API Base URL**: `http://192.168.8.100:8003`
- **Health Check Endpoint**: `/api/v1/health/health`

## 🚀 **Quick Setup Steps**

### 1. **Ensure Both Devices Are Connected**
- ✅ **Laptop**: Connected to Wi-Fi (IP: 192.168.8.100)
- ✅ **Mobile Device**: Connected to the same Wi-Fi network

### 2. **Start Your FastAPI Server**
Make sure your FastAPI server is running with external access:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    import uvicorn
    uvicorn.run(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=8003)  # Allow external connections
```

### 3. **Test the Connection**
**From your mobile device browser**, visit:
```
http://192.168.8.100:8003/api/v1/health/health
```

You should see a response like:
```json
{"status": "healthy"}
```

### 4. **Run Your Flutter App**
1. **Hot restart** your Flutter app (not just hot reload)
2. **Open the drawer** and tap "API Health Check"
3. **Check the console** for connection status

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting**

### **If Connection Fails:**

1. **Check Windows Firewall**
   - Allow port 8003 through Windows Firewall
   - Or temporarily disable firewall for testing

2. **Verify Network Connection**
   ```bash
   # On your laptop, test locally
   curl http://127.0.0.1:8003/api/v1/health/health
   
   # Test with your IP
   curl http://192.168.8.100:8003/api/v1/health/health
   ```

3. **Check Router Settings**
   - Some routers block device-to-device communication
   - Try connecting both devices to mobile hotspot for testing

4. **Verify FastAPI Host Setting**
   - Must use `host="0.0.0.0"` not `host="127.0.0.1"`
   - Port 8003 must be open

### **Network Commands**

**Find your IP again (if it changes):**
```bash
ipconfig
```

**Test from mobile browser:**

## 📋 **Expected Console Output**

**✅ Success:**
```
📡 API Configuration:
   Base URL: http://192.168.8.100:8003
   Connect Timeout: 30 seconds
   Receive Timeout: 60 seconds

🔍 Testing API connection...
✅ Successfully connected to FastAPI backend at http://192.168.8.100:8003
🚀 API is ready for file conversions!
```

**❌ Failure:**
```
❌ Failed to connect to FastAPI backend
📋 Please ensure your FastAPI server is running on http://192.168.8.100:8003
💡 You can test your API by visiting: http://192.168.8.100:8003/docs
```

## 🎯 **Next Steps**

1. **Test the health check** in the drawer
2. **Try file conversion** features
3. **Monitor console** for any errors
4. **Check network stability** during file uploads

Your mobile device should now be able to communicate with your FastAPI server! 🎉
