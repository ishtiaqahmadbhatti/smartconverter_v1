# ✅ Download Endpoint Fixed!

## 🎯 **Issue Identified & Resolved**

### **Problem:**
Your Flutter app was trying to download from the wrong endpoint:
- ❌ **Flutter was trying**: `http://192.168.8.100:8003/download/{filename}`
- ✅ **Correct endpoint**: `http://192.168.8.100:8003/api/v1/convert/download/{filename}`

### **Solution Applied:**
1. ✅ **Updated Flutter app** to try the correct endpoint first
2. ✅ **Added endpoint to API config** for consistency
3. ✅ **Verified endpoint works** (returns proper 404 for missing files)

## 🔧 **Changes Made:**

### **1. Updated ConversionService**
- Added correct endpoint as first priority: `/api/v1/convert/download/{filename}`
- Kept fallback endpoints for compatibility

### **2. Updated ApiConfig**
- Added `downloadEndpoint = '/api/v1/convert/download'`
- Centralized endpoint configuration

### **3. Verified Endpoint**
- Tested endpoint exists and responds correctly
- Confirmed it returns proper error messages

## 🚀 **Next Steps:**

### **Test the Fix:**
1. **Hot reload** your Flutter app
2. **Try the "Add page numbers" feature** again
3. **Check console logs** - you should see:
   ```
   Trying download URL: http://192.168.8.100:8003/api/v1/convert/download/filename.pdf
   ✅ Successfully downloaded from: http://192.168.8.100:8003/api/v1/convert/download/filename.pdf
   ```

### **Expected Result:**
- ✅ App will try the correct endpoint first
- ✅ Download should succeed if file exists
- ✅ You'll get the actual PDF file instead of text instructions
- ✅ PDF will open properly in any PDF viewer

## 📋 **What Was Wrong:**

Your FastAPI server has the download endpoint at:
```
/api/v1/convert/download/{filename}
```

But your Flutter app was trying:
```
/download/{filename}
```

This mismatch caused the 404 errors and fallback to placeholder files.

## 🎉 **The Fix:**

The Flutter app now tries the correct endpoint first:
```
http://192.168.8.100:8003/api/v1/convert/download/{filename}
```

**Try the feature now - it should work perfectly!** 🚀

## 📱 **If Still Not Working:**

If you still get issues:
1. Check that your processing endpoint saves files to the correct directory
2. Verify the filename in the API response matches the saved file
3. Check server logs for any errors during file saving
4. Make sure the file actually exists on the server

The endpoint configuration is now correct - the issue should be resolved! ✅
